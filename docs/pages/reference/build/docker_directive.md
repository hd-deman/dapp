Docker can build images by [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) instructions. These instructions can be divided into two groups: build-time instructions and other instructions that effect on a running built image and a built image in general.  

Build-time instructions don't make sense in a dapp build process, therefore, dapp supports only following instructions:

* `USER` to set the user and the group to use when running the image (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user)).
* `WORKDIR` to set the working directory (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir)).
* `VOLUME` to add mount point (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume)).
* `ENV` to set the environment variable (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env)).
* `LABEL` to add metadata to an image (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#label)).
* `EXPOSE` to inform Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose))
* `ENTRYPOINT` to configure a container that will run as an executable (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint)).
* `CMD` to provide default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT` to configure a container that will run as an executable (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd)).
* `ONBUILD` to add to the image a trigger instruction to be executed at a later time when the image is used as the base for another build (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild)).
* `STOPSIGNAL` to set the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#stopsignal))
* `HEALTHCHECK` to tell Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck))

These instructions can be defined in the dappfile `docker` section.

Here are the example of using docker instructions:

```yaml
docker:
  WORKDIR: /app
  CMD: ['python', './index.py']
  EXPOSE: '5000'
  ENV:
    TERM: xterm
    LC_ALL: en_US.UTF-8
```

Defined docker instructions are applied on the last stage called `docker_instructions`. Thus instructions don't effect on other stages and a dapp build process in general, they simply will be applied on a result image. 

If need to use special environment variables in build-time of your application image, such as `TERM` environment, you should use a [base image]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/build/base_image.html) with these variables.

> Tip: you can also implement exporting environment variables right in [_user stage_]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/build/assembly_instructions.html#what-is-user-stages) instructions.
